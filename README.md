Yugioh-Pack-Opening-Simulator
=============================

This is a simulator for opening booster packs from the popular TCG by Konami Yu-Gi-Oh!

In this version, users are able to select the set from which they want to open booster packs. Then, the resulting output will simulate one's "pulls". 

Potential Uses
=============================
1) Dont have to spend $4 "because you like the thrill" - lets be real, we never pull anything good anyway.
2) Virtual satisfaction at any time
3) Draft (future updates)
4) Gauge value of a set (future updates)
5) Dont have to get up to go to target/walmart/locals to buy packs
6) Need I go on?
